# The Assignment
The objectif of this assignment is to demonstrate techinques of exploratory data analysis by using plotting systems.
We will use two of the three plotting systems: the base plotting system and the ggplot2 plotting systems.

## Instructions
The instructions to resolve the project can be found in the document EDAW4Project2Instructions.docx

## Brief overview of scripts and plots provided.

### Plot1.R
In this script we plotted (by using the base plotting system) the total emissions of PM2.5 for years 1999 to 2008.

### Plot2.R
This script will plot the changes in emissions of PM2.5 during the years from 1999 to 2008 for the Balitmore City in Maryland.
Here again we will use the base plotting system.

### Plot3.R
This script will use the ggplot2 plotting system to plot the changes of emissions of PM2.5 for the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable during the years of 1999 to 2008.

### Plot4.R
This script will, by using the base plotting system, plot the changes in emissions of PM2.5 from coal combustion related for all U.S. during the years 1999 to 2009.
We will assume here that the coal information

## Notes:
Each script will provide a "scriptName.png" file that will answer the questions.
